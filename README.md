# Pyrite
Simple cubic lattice cellular automaton pyrite crystal growth in SciForth (Forth83 modified by the author) and CM2 C*.

C* was pronounced 'C Star' in line with another Connection Machine language, *Lisp.

SciForth was modified Forth83 which used standard text files instead of Forth block files, with added matrix computation functions and a text editor.  All modifications by myself.  It was part of an unfinished stab at a PhD in Geology.  It ran under the Digital Research CPM/80 operating system on an Osborne 1 portable computer with a 3.75 MHz Z80 8 bit CPU, 4K ROM, 56K RAM.  I used forth so that I could maximise space for data in the simulation.
